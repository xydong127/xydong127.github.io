 
## Biography
I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html), supervised by [Prof. Sibo Wang](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~swang/).

Before that, I obtained my B.E. in Computer Science and Technology from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) in 2021.

## Research Interests
I am interested in graph representation learning and data mining. Current topics include: 

- Scalable Graph Neural Networks
- Graph Anomaly Detection
- Graph Neural Networks with Large Language Models
